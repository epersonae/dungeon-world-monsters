Dungeon World Monsters
======================

Dungeon World Monsters Reorganized

This was my own little obsessive project, because I wanted an A-Z index of all the monsters, rather than separated by setting! I thought I'd share what I've got, in case it's helpful to anyone else.

So far, I've just got XSLT to turn the fairly flat InDesign XML into something a little more structured. I'm planning on importing it into Drupal eventually, since that's my favored tool.
