Dungeon World Monsters
======================

Dungeon World Monsters Reorganized

This was my own little obsessive project, because I wanted an A-Z index of all the monsters, rather than separated by setting! I thought I'd share what I've got, in case it's helpful to anyone else.

There's two pieces to this:

* XSLT and XML. I've turned the fairly flat InDesign XML into something more structured.

* Drupal Feature. The dungeon_world_monster_compendium folder contains files for building your own listing of monsters in Drupal. You probably need to have the Features module enabled to do this. (Plus all the dependent modules.)
